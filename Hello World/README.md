# Hello World

This is the most easy Hello World program, to be used by the testing function in mydaco. 
The testing replys with the name that you send to the action.

Noteworthy is: You can use the testing later on to test your programs with arbitrary parameters and using different entry points.

However, calling the Action without an interface or entry function will not be a real scenario to access your action from outside.
